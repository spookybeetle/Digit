		<p>HTML was definitly one of the easier programming languages I have learned, and having prior knowledge on how to use HTML and website designing tools like Dreamweaver really helped me get through this. However, for someone knew to HTML, or programming in general, it can be really overwhelming to see a huge block of code with all these different colors wihtin brackets and other colors. Also debugging. God debugging. If you have never programmed before and do not know why something isn't working and have never debugged before, it is going to be a nightmare.</p>
		
		<p>I definitly prefer using wordpress, or anything similar, over starting a website from scratch. It is dificult to figure out where to start when making something out of nothing. However, making a website by hand with just code and no premade templates gives you a lot more freedom to design things the way you want them. In wordpress it is a lot more dificult to get borders around images and page divisions.</p>
		
		<p>Something I really ran into an issue with was how the page changes when the browser window changes. For example the web page I made from scratch does not change appropriately with the browser window. Otehrwise, everything was really just trial and error. Nothing was too, too complicated for me to figure out on my own. Wordpress is rather simple to modify the content of, and if you are okay with simply changing the theme of the site to rearange the layout then that is super simple for anyone to really pick up. However actually changing the layout on your own gets really complicated because of the mix of other programming languages that are thrown in there to make certain things work.</p>
		
		<p>To work with either site, you really just need to know how to read and rearange HTML and have some patience. Programming is a whole song and dance of trial and error. If you can't be patient then you aren't going to get anywhere.</p>
		
		<p>I want to learn how to use Dreamweaver more efficiently. I liked being able to open my files up in it to see how my pages were looking. And I would like to be able to actually develop in the program without getting overwhelmed (also how to make the page change with the browser window).</p>
