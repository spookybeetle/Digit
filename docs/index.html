	<div class="content" ><h2 class="h2">Hello!</h2><p>I’m a 20 year old Digital Media, Arts, and Technology major with a Game Development minor at Penn State Berhend. I love to create digital art, sing, swim, and play video games. I am from Westminster, Maryland. Practically grew up in the middle of a corn field (so no I did not know how to use the bus system when I moved here, and no I do not know any of this city slang). To every extent of the meaning I am country. I grew up with chickens in the backyard and horses and cattle across the way from me. I know how to milk cows n goats, and I know that you can’t keep more than one roo with your layin’ hens cause they’ll kill each other.

I have two cats, one of which lives with me here on campus. He is a devious little ceeture. He likes to eat cheese, cantaloupe, any kind of meat, and ice cream. He is my motivation. I would die for him. Anyways.</p>
